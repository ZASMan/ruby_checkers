# ruby_checkers
The goal of this is to create a command line checkers game that can be played between two players. My goal is to test my knowledge as a programmer and ability to make a large and complex program in more or less pure Ruby while keeping the code modular and DRY. I see this as a stepping stone to develop a chess game. I'll be using RSpec to stay consistent with test driven development along the way.
